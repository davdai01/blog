title: Vim NERDTree z/OS Plugin
---
As a Vim user and a IBM mainframe user, I'd like to use Vim to edit mainframe files,
so I wrote a Vim Plugin for this purpose
Once installed in Vim, we can choose to open any file (in PDS or Unix file
system) and edit it. Changes will be automatically synced to mainframe when you
save it in Vim. Furthermore, if it's for JCL file, we will be able to submit the
JCL to mainframe directly from Vim using command :JCLSubmit
